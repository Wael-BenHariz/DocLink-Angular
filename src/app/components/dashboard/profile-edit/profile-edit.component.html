This Angular medical service project includes all the components, services, and models needed for your healthcare platform. Here's a breakdown of what I've created:

### Core Features

1. **Authentication System**
   - Registration and login components with form validation
   - JWT token-based authentication (mocked for now)
   - User roles (Patient, Doctor, Admin)

2. **Home Page**
   - Hero section with call-to-action buttons
   - Feature cards highlighting key benefits
   - Featured doctors section
   - Testimonials carousel
   - Statistics section

3. **Doctor Listing**
   - Grid of doctor cards with search and filter functionality
   - Doctor details page with tabs for about, services, reviews, and availability
   - Star rating component for reviews

4. **Service Listing**
   - Grid of service cards with search and filter functionality
   - Service details with pricing and duration

5. **Appointment Booking**
   - Form to select doctor, service, date, and time
   - Available time slots based on doctor availability
   - Reason for visit description

6. **User Dashboard**
   - Appointment history with filtering by status
   - Profile editing
   - Different views for patients and doctors

### Technical Implementation

- **Models**: All models match your C# backend models
- **Services**: Auth, Doctor, Service, and Appointment services with mock data
- **Components**: Organized by feature with proper separation of concerns
- **Styling**: Clean healthcare-themed design with responsive layouts
- **Routing**: Complete routing configuration with guards for protected routes

### Integration Points

The code is structured to easily integrate with your backend:
- Mock services can be replaced with HTTP calls to your API
- Models match your backend entities
- Authentication is set up to work with JWT tokens

To run this project, you'll need to:
1. Create a new Angular project
2. Copy these files into the appropriate directories
3. Install dependencies (Bootstrap, Font Awesome)
4. Replace the mock data with API calls when your backend is ready
